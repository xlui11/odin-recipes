            <li>4 burger buns (preferably brioche or potato buns)</li>
            <li> tbsp truffle oil (white or black, depending on your preference)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp truffle butter (optional but adds richness)</li>
            <li>1 cup arugula or mixed greens (optional, but adds a fresh contrast)</li>
            <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced and caramelized</li>
            <li>4 slices of your favorite cheese (preferably Gruyère or aged cheddar)</li>
            <li>Truffle salt (for extra flavor, optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
    <div class= "list">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>caramelize the onions:</strong> In a pan, heat butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add thinly sliced onions, sprinkle with salt and sugar, and cook for 20-30 minutes until golden brown and caramelized. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the beef patties:</strong> Divide 1 lb of ground beef into 4 balls (about 4 oz each). Roll into balls and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Smash the patties:</strong> Heat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat, drizzle with truffle oil. Place a beef ball on the hot surface and smash it flat with a spatula. Season with salt and pepper, then cook for 2-3 minutes until a crispy crust forms.</li>
            <li><strong>Flip and add cheese:</strong> Flip the patty, add a slice of cheese, and cover to melt for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong> Toast the buns:</strong> While patties cook, slice buns and toast them with butter or truffle butter in a separate pan until golden.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the burgers:</strong> Brush the toasted buns with truffle oil, then place arugula or greens on the bottom bun. Add the cheese-topped patty, caramelized onions, and any extra truffle oil or truffle salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Top with the other bun half and serve immediately with fries or truffle fries.</li>
        </ol>
